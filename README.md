## Controls

- WASD: Move camera.
- Hold left mouse button + drag: look around
- 1 (numpad): Camera free fly mode
- 2 (numpad): Camera bound to terrain mode
- N: Generate new landscape

## System requirements

Windows XP or later (Windows 2000 may work but has not been tested), graphic card and drivers supporting OpenGL GLSL shaders.
To work properly, Terrain.exe has to be in the same directory as the Models, Shaders and Textures directories with their original contents.
